## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

# Prerequisites
**Note**: For this project to run properly you must have a running version of GraphQL Server.
https://github.com/diamond2010/graphql-server.
It is a simple implementation of a GraphQL server.
Please make sure that the server is running before you proceed with the rest.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@graphql/mylib`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
